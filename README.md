Develop a web application or a mobile app where users enter a password to open the application. The user can change the password. The password should be stored encrypted in the database. Using the app, users can create various text notes. The user needs to specify a title for the newly created note when they save them. The previously created notes should be visible in the application user interface. The user can edit or delete any note. Users can label the notes based on specific categories (Grocery, Important Information, Account Passwords, Todo List). The notes list can be sorted according to the date it is created, alphabetically with note titles, or based on categories. The user should be able to select the sorting options in the application.
